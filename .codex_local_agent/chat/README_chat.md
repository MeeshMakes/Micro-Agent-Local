# README_chat.md

This folder tracks conversational transcripts for the Local Codex agent. Each session subdirectory is named by UTC date and contains `chat.md`, which renders thinking in italic dark green and responses in bright white text to satisfy the high-contrast requirement.

Do not delete or rewrite session history; always append.
