# Acceptance — Mini-app Dock + Script Creator
- Timestamp: 2025-10-31T01:03:34Z
- Spec: Required-Updates.md §§3–4

## Verification Steps
1. Launched Local Agent UI and toggled Script Creator/Agent Manager buttons — dock arrow appeared and panels reopened on subsequent toggles without losing state.
2. Collapsed the blue arrow handle — dock width dropped to zero while icon badges stayed active; expanding restored panel layouts.
3. Ran Script Creator with Desktop shortcut and description — project folder gained README.md plus `.codex_local_agent/` containing agent.yaml, agent.md, logs/, dataset/, history/, patches/, macros/, styles/ with default-dark pack and Task-Index stub.
4. Re-ran Script Creator targeting the same file with content — overwrite dialog showed preview and respected a No response.

## Evidence
- UI behavior: manual inspection within running PySide6 app (micro_agent.py `DockBar`, `DockHandleButton`, `LeftDockStack`).
- Repo bootstrap: inspected generated folder contents on disk, confirming scaffolded files and chat_history.md.
- Command safety: Verified `python -m compileall micro_agent.py` (see test log) to ensure syntax integrity after changes.
