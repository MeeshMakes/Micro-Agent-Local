# Acceptance — Chat Panel Layout (Required-Updates §1)

- [x] Transcript and chat input stacked vertically within the left column of `ChatPanel` (micro_agent.py).
- [x] Ask/Do Work mode toggles sit next to a dedicated Send button directly beneath the input box.
- [x] Task Feed and staged changes render in the right column via `QSplitter`, matching review-on-the-right guidance.
- [x] Ctrl+Enter defaults to Do Work mode and toggles the Do Work button before sending.
- [x] High-contrast styling maintained for all labels, buttons, and the new Send control.
- [x] Verified by running `python -m py_compile micro_agent.py`.
