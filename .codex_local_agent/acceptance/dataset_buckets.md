# Acceptance — Required-Updates §2 (Dataset Buckets & OCR)

- **Scope:** Dual OCR persistence, dataset row enrichment, logic bucket versioning, diff logging.
- **Implementation Evidence:**
  - `micro_agent.py` — BucketStore class under `.codex_local_agent/memory/buckets` with append-only versions, status beats, and diff artifacts.
  - Dataset logging adds `bucket_id`, sanitized tags, and SHA-256 hashes while invoking dual OCR capture.
- **Verification:**
  - `python -m compileall micro_agent.py` (passes) — validates updated code compiles.
  - Manual inspection confirmed new files appear under `.codex_local_agent/memory/buckets/` on agent usage.
- **Status:** ✅ Completed 2025-10-31T00:06:52+00:00 (UTC).
