# README_acceptance.md

This directory stores structured acceptance evidence for completed Required-Updates buckets. Each file should document the acceptance criteria, verification commands, and resulting status so auditors can confirm compliance.

Entries are append-only. When a requirement is satisfied, write a new acceptance record instead of editing older ones.
