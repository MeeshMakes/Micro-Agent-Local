## Update @ 2025-10-30T09:21:26.131634+00:00
Objective: Bootstrap governance loop and seed control files.

Files touched: Agents.md; .codex_local_agent/memory/bank_core.jsonl; .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl; .codex_local_agent/chat/sessions/20251030/chat.md; docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md; docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md; logs/session_20251030.md.

Problems: Full Required-Updates backlog still pending task stubs and implementation.

Next steps: Expand logic inbox coverage, implement highest-priority UI overhaul per Required-Updates.md.

## Update @ 2025-10-30T09:38:55.257642+00:00
Objective: Extend governance scaffolding per Required-Updates instructions.

Files touched: .codex_local_agent/impl_check/.gitkeep; .codex_local_agent/acceptance/.gitkeep; .codex_local_agent/diffqa/.gitkeep; .codex_local_agent/config/overrides/.gitkeep; .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl; docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md; docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md.

Progress: Added governance directories, appended new Required-Updates stubs (133-136) to logic inbox and progress tracker.

Next steps: Implement new toolchains (data viewer, diff packager, migration assistant, health dashboard) per stubs.


## Update @ 2025-10-30T10:41:55.684429+00:00
Objective: Deliver DataFrame viewer toolkit per RU-133.

Files touched: micro_agent.py; system_tools/data_viewer.py; agent; sample; tests/test_data_viewer.py; pytest.ini; .codex_local_agent/data_view/*; docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md; docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md; .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl.

Progress: Implemented mini-app UI, CLI commands, audit storage, and automated tests.

Next steps: Extend diff packager (RU-134) and related dashboards.

## Update @ 2025-10-30T11:20:30.000000+00:00
Objective: Ship diff packager, legacy migration assistant, and system health dashboard (RU-134–136).

Files touched: system_tools/diff_packager.py; system_tools/legacy_migration.py; system_tools/system_health.py; agent; micro_agent.py; tests/test_diff_packager.py; tests/test_legacy_migration.py; tests/test_system_health.py; .codex_local_agent/diff_pkg/*; .codex_local_agent/migrate_legacy/*; .codex_local_agent/health/*; .codex_local_agent/chat/sessions/2025-10-30/chat.md; docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md; docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md; .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl.

Issues: None — new modules integrate with existing UI/CLI and persist audit artifacts.

Next steps: Run full pytest suite and finalize Required-Updates bookkeeping.
