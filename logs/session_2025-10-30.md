# Session Log — 2025-10-30 (UTC)

## Objective
Establish the mandatory control directories, ledgers, and audit logs required by Required-Updates.md section "Global Agent Operations & Repo-Wide Enforcement" so future work can progress.

## Files Touched
- .codex_local_agent/memory/
- .codex_local_agent/acceptance/
- .codex_local_agent/diffqa/
- .codex_local_agent/impl_check/
- .codex_local_agent/config/overrides/

- docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md
- docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md
- Implemented-Updates.md
- Missing-Updates.md
- Required-Updates.md
- memory/logic_inbox.jsonl
- .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl

## Issues Encountered
- Repository was missing the mandated `.codex_local_agent/memory` structure and mirrored task queue.
- Spec verification block had not been instantiated at the end of Required-Updates.md.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Populate acceptance and impl-check artifacts once additional Required-Updates sections are implemented.
2. Continue parsing Required-Updates.md to generate task stubs for outstanding buckets beyond the initial ones.
3. Implement the UI and workflow requirements starting with sections 1–5.

## Update 2025-10-30T14:08:02.202070+00:00
### Objective
Align chat workspace geometry with Required-Updates.md §1 by moving controls next to the input and dedicating the right column to review panels.
### Files Touched
- micro_agent.py
- docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md
- docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md
### Issues Encountered
- Needed to refactor existing layout code that assumed Ask/Do Work buttons lived in the header.
### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Implement dataset capture + OCR persistence from Required-Updates.md §2.
2. Refresh acceptance artifacts for the chat layout change once UI smoke tests are added.
3. Continue migrating remaining mini-app and authority manager requirements.
