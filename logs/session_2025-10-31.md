# Session Log — 2025-10-31 (UTC)

## Objective
Implement outstanding Required-Updates buckets sequentially under the codified sync loop while maintaining append-only evidence and high-contrast UI guarantees.

## Files Touched
- micro_agent.py
- docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md
- docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md
- .codex_local_agent/chat/sessions/2025-10-31/chat.md
- logs/session_2025-10-31.md

## Issues Encountered
- Needed to design a deterministic bucket identifier so repeated logic blocks roll forward instead of duplicating entries.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Rescan Required-Updates.md and Agent.md, then tackle the first unmet bucket with full logging.
2. Capture acceptance and implementation evidence for each completed requirement before advancing.
3. Keep memory, changelog, and progress ledgers updated with UTC timestamps.

## Update 2025-10-31T00:06:52+00:00
### Objective
Deliver Required-Updates §2 by capturing dual OCR dataset rows linked to versioned logic buckets with diff history.
### Files Touched
- micro_agent.py
- docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md
- docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md
- .codex_local_agent/memory/logic_inbox.jsonl
- memory/logic_inbox.jsonl
### Issues Encountered
- Existing chat logging lacked a reusable bucket store; implemented append-only BucketStore with diff snapshots and status beats.
### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Add acceptance artifact documenting bucket store verification under `.codex_local_agent/acceptance/`.
2. Continue with Required-Updates §3 mini-app dock improvements.
3. Extend memory/codex_memory.json with the new bucket/dataset guarantees.

## Update 2025-10-31T01:02:31Z
### Objective
Ship Required-Updates §§3–4 by delivering the sliding mini-app dock with arrow handle and the full Script Creator bootstrap pipeline.
### Files Touched
- micro_agent.py
- docs/codex-local/required_updates_progress.md
- docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md
### Issues Encountered
- Dock splitter sizing needed explicit tracking so collapsing the column did not reset active panel state.
### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Capture acceptance evidence for the dock + Script Creator scope under `.codex_local_agent/acceptance/mini_app_dock_script_creator.md`.
2. Propagate new repo bootstrap defaults into codex_memory.json for reuse.
3. Move on to Agent Manager authority extensions (Required-Updates.md §5).
