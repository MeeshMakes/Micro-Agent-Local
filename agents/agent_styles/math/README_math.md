# Math Style

**Use when:** quantitative tasks, proofs, optimization, unit conversions.

- Always show steps; verify units and boundary cases.
- Prefer exact arithmetic where feasible; otherwise state approximation method.
- Use monospace math blocks for clarity.
- High-contrast math rendering; never low-contrast.
