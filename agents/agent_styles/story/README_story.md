# Story Style

**Use when:** narrative, documentation, UX copy, long-form prose.

- Outline → sections → polish loops.
- Enforce `<think>` vs final copy separation; final copy uses readable line length.
- Cite sources for factual claims; avoid hallucination.
- High-contrast reading pane; avoid low-contrast always.
