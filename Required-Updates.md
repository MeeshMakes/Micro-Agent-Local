## Mandatory Requirements
- Maintain a high-contrast UI across all screens. Bright foreground text on dark backgrounds is required.
- Enforce the Required-Updates Sync Loop so every obligation is tracked and logged before shipping changes.

## Missing Features
1. **UI instrumentation** — add automated checks that verify screens honor the high-contrast rule and surface violations inside the workbench.
2. **Sync status telemetry** — display real-time sync state between `.codex_local_agent` artifacts and on-disk files so drift is visible.
3. **Memory mirroring** — mirror entries from `dataset/memory.jsonl` into a summarized context view that the agent can reference quickly.
4. **Context summarizer** — generate rolling summaries of recent chats and diffs to keep long sessions manageable.
5. **Pipeline health monitors** — add heartbeat tests covering OCR, chat logging, and diff staging so regressions are caught early.

Each missing feature must be represented as a task stub in `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` and tracked until implemented.
